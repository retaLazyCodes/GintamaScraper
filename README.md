# Gintama Web Scraper

## Goal:

This project was born with the idea of ​​creating a Tier list of the plot arcs of the anime "Gintama", (taking advantage of the fact that I am rewatching the series).

For this I need to do 4 things:
1) Obtain the info of all the plot arcs (quickly and easily).
2) Save them in a database.
3) Get that data from a Rest API.
4) And finally create a Frontend application that consumes said API, with which you can make the Tier list.

## How to run

1. Install [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) to run.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the root project folder.
4. Now run ```dotnet build``` to compile the project.
5. Finally run ```dotnet run --project GintamaArcsScrapper``` to run the app.
