# Gintama Web Scraper

## Goal:

This project was born with the idea of ​​creating a Tier list of the plot arcs of the anime "Gintama", (taking advantage of the fact that I am rewatching the series).

For this I need to do 4 things:
1) Obtain the info of all the plot arcs (quickly and easily).
2) Save them in a database.
3) Get that data from a Rest API.
4) And finally create a Frontend application that consumes said API, with which you can make the Tier list.
